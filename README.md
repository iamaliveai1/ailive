## 1. Introduction
Have you ever dreamed of running a website that requires no manual intervention, yet is able to generate posts, interact with visitors, and even make sales on your behalf? Well, with the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), that dream is now a reality.

This project It allows creating entities (bots) that can interact with the outside world (e.g chat with people, post on social media, etc).
Such fully automated entities can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
- Fully automated websites (e.g blog, news, sports, finance, etc)
- Social:
  - Fully automated social media accounts (e.g bot runs on new account)
  - Increase the engagement of social media accounts (proving that the account is active). It can be fully automated or semi-automated in which is the account manager need to approve the actions before they are executed.
  - Advise the account manager on the best actions to take (e.g what to post, when to post, etc)
- Marketing:
  - Fully automated marketing campaigns, while the content for entire campaign is generated by AI

The project is composed of 4 main components:
- readers: collection of readers that read data from the outside world (e.g chat, social media, etc). Readers are implemented as plugins. For example:
  - news: reads news from a news website
  - wordpress: reads posts from a wordpress website
- engine: defines the AI model used to generate responses
  - prompt: defines the personality of the entity
  - model: defines the model to be user (e.g GPT-3, GPT-3.5, etc)
- writers: collection of SDK that automate the execution of tasks. Writers are implemented as plugins. For example:
  - chat: sends messages to a chat
  - wordpress: posts on a wordpress website
  - social: posts on social media (e.g twitter, facebook, etc)
- runner: orchestrates the execution of the readers, engine and writers. This is done by running the engine (chatGPT) in a loop, allowing it to interact with the outside world
